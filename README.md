**Lattice gets your annotations and ideas out of the per-paper silo.** See every highlight across your whole library in one place, filter and export them with citations, and promote the ones that matter into a searchable, taggable, cross-linked idea layer — all while staying linked to the source. Outline your paper and Lattice gathers every quote and note you filed under each heading into a first draft. It also includes grounded AI Q&A that answers from your PDFs with clickable page citations.

> The name: a _lattice_ is a network of connected nodes — which is exactly what your ideas become once they're no longer trapped in the single paper they came from.

> 📖 **New here? Start with the [Getting Started guide](doc/GETTING_STARTED.md)** — a 10-minute walkthrough of every feature.

## ✨ Features

### 🗂️ Cross-paper annotation browser

- **See all highlights in one place** — a single library-wide window listing every annotation, not one PDF at a time.
- **Filter** by **colour**, **tag**, **keyword**, and type — combined live.
- **Export the filtered set with citations** — copy as Markdown or HTML, or save as a standalone Zotero note. Each source is cited once (using your Zotero citation style) with its highlights beneath.
- **Jump to source** — click any annotation to open the PDF at that exact spot.

### 🧠 Citavi-style idea layer

- **Promote** any annotation into a first-class **idea** — a real Zotero note that's searchable and taggable on its own.
- **Tag ideas** in place, **link ideas to one another**, and **link back to the source** paper via Zotero relations.
- **Browse the layer** in its own tab — your thinking is reachable independently of the paper it came from, which is what breaks down past a few hundred sources.

### 📚 Knowledge Organizer (Citavi-style outline → draft)

- **Outline first, then fill it in** — build the heading structure of your book, paper, or literature review, then file quotes and notes under each heading as you read.
- **A heading is just a tag** — each heading is a real Zotero tag (prefixed `§`), so you can file a highlight under a heading straight from Zotero's own annotation tag box while reading, and it's gathered automatically — no separate mode to switch into.
- **Generate a first draft** — Lattice gathers everything under every heading, in outline order, with citations, into a Markdown/HTML document or a standalone Zotero note. No copy-pasting, no endless text shuffling.

### 💬 Grounded AI Q&A

- **Single-paper Q&A** from a side panel in the reader, and **multi-paper Q&A** across selected items.
- **Grounded, clickable citations** — `[Page N]` / `[Paper N, Page M]` jump straight to the cited page.
- **Save answers as annotations** so AI-surfaced insights flow into the annotation browser and idea layer.
- **Bring your own model** — Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Ollama (local), DeepSeek, Grok (xAI). Keys stay in Zotero's own preferences; run fully offline with Ollama.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the latest `lattice.xpi` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/birugit/zotero-grounded-qa/releases).
2. In Zotero, open **Tools → Plugins** (or **Add-ons**).
3. Click the gear icon ⚙ in the top-right → **Install Plugin From File…**
4. Select the downloaded `.xpi` file.
5. **Restart Zotero.**

> [!note]
> Requires **Zotero 7+**. For Q&A, each PDF's text must be indexed — open a PDF in the reader once, or right-click the item → **Reindex Item**. The annotation browser and idea layer work on your existing highlights and notes immediately.

---

## 💬 Usage

### Browse all annotations

1. **Tools → All Annotations.**
2. On the **📑 Annotations** tab: filter by the **colour** swatches, **tag** dropdown, type, and the **search** box.
3. Export with **Copy as Markdown / Copy as HTML / Save as note**, or click a row to open the source.
4. Click **★ Promote to idea** on a row (or **★ Promote all to ideas**) to send annotations into the idea layer.

### Work the idea layer

1. In the same window, switch to the **🧠 Ideas** tab (or **Tools → Idea Layer (Citavi)**).
2. **➕ New idea**, or work with promoted ones: add/remove tags inline, **📄 Open source**, **🔗 Link to…** another idea, **🗑 Delete**.
3. Ideas are ordinary Zotero notes tagged `★idea` — so they're fully searchable and taggable in Zotero itself and they sync.

### Organize into a draft

1. **Tools → Knowledge Organizer** (or the **🗂 Organizer** tab in the **All Annotations** window).
2. Build your outline: **➕ Add heading**, then **✎** rename, **▲ ▼** reorder among siblings, and **⭲ / ⭰** indent / outdent to nest sub-headings.
3. File sources under a heading two ways:
   - **In the panel** — select a heading, then under **"File a quote or note here"** search your annotations and click **File here**.
   - **While reading** — in Zotero's reader, add the heading's tag (shown under the heading, e.g. `§Introduction`) to any highlight. It appears under that heading automatically.
4. Click **📄 Generate draft** → preview it, toggle **Markdown / HTML**, optionally tick **Include empty headings**, then **📋 Copy** or **📝 Save as note**.
5. **Rename** a heading and every quote filed under it follows the rename; **delete** a heading and your items keep their tags — nothing filed is lost.

### Ask grounded questions

- **Single paper:** open a PDF → **Grounded Q&A** section in the item pane → ask (Ctrl/⌘+Enter). Click `[Page N]` to jump; **📌 Save to annotations** to keep the answer.
- **Multiple papers:** select 2+ items → right-click → **"Q&A: Ask across selected papers."** Citations are `[Paper N, Page M]`; **📌 Save all to annotations** anchors the answer on each cited paper.

## 🔑 Configuration (Q&A only)

Open **Zotero → Settings (⌘,) → Lattice** in the left panel.

1. **AI Provider** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, DeepSeek, or Grok.
2. **API Key** — paste your key (not required for Ollama).
3. **Base URL** — shown for Ollama; defaults to `http://localhost:11434`.
4. **Model** — choose from the provider's model list.
5. **Test connection** — confirms provider, key, and model before you rely on them.

## 🗂️ How it works

- **Annotations** are read library-wide from Zotero's data model (each highlight is an `annotation` item under its PDF), indexed in memory, and kept fresh via Zotero's Notifier.
- **Ideas** are native standalone notes tagged `★idea`; links use Zotero's own item-relation system, so nothing lives in a private database.
- **The Knowledge Organizer** stores your outline as a single native note tagged `★outline` (the heading tree as JSON), and every heading is an ordinary Zotero tag (prefixed `§`). So the outline and everything filed under it sync like any other item, and filing works from Zotero's own reader — again, no private database.
- **Q&A** extracts per-page PDF text via `PDFWorker`, builds a context with `[Page N]` markers, asks your chosen provider to cite every claim, and turns the citations into clickable links. Answers can be saved as page-anchored note annotations.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**"No text found in this PDF."** Zotero hasn't indexed the PDF — open it in the reader once, or right-click → **Reindex Item**. Scanned PDFs without OCR have no extractable text.

**"API key not set."** Add your key in **Settings → Lattice**, then **Test connection**. (Not required for Ollama.)

**Q&A citations aren't clickable.** The model didn't emit the expected citation format; try a more capable model (Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT-5.4 Pro), which follow the instructions more reliably.

**New colours/tags don't appear in the filter row.** Those rows are built when the window opens — close and reopen **All Annotations** to pick up newly added colours/tags.

**Nothing shows under a heading in the Organizer.** Filing uses the heading's exact tag, shown beneath the heading (e.g. `§Introduction`). If you tag highlights in the reader, match that tag exactly — or rename the heading from the panel, which re-tags everything filed under it for you.
